        <h1 class="text-center text-3xl mb-2">The 4 principles of Organic Farming</h1>
        <h2 class="text-center text-xl bg-[#F8EEE3]">With a large number of people shifting toward organic products, ever wondered what are the principles that guide organic agriculture?</h2>
        <p class=" pt-5">The 4 principles guides of organic farming, namely- Health, ecology, fairness, and care. Let us understand in detail how these principles form the foundation of organic farming.

<p class="p-5 m-2"><b>1.	Health:</b>
What we mean by health is the health of the ecosystem, the animals, and the humans. The main emphasis is the health of the soil. As this is the foundation of a healthy plant. The main bane of non-organic farming methods is the use of excessive chemicals that harm the soil and microbes.
 
     
Ensuring the health of the soil in turn promotes the health of the microorganisms present in them. This, in turn, provides healthy food for plants in the form of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen among others.

Thus a healthy plant provides healthy nutrition for anyone who consumes them. This, in turn, provides a toxin-free diet to anyone who feeds on animals that feed on herbivores. In this process, the accumulation of toxins as we move from one level of the food chain to another is greatly reduced.
</p>
<p class="p-5 m-2">
<b>2.	Ecology:</b>
The methods that are used in organic farming ensure that the overall balance in the ecosystem is maintained. The practices 
used in organic agriculture guarantee
minimal environmental pollution.
 
This, in turn, helps in improving the quality of 
air, soil, and water. These farming methods 
help in decelerating environmental pollution. 
This helps in the betterment of flora and
 fauna in that particular area.
</p>

3.	Fairness:
</b>
What we mean by fairness here is equity. How just, caring and respectful are every step involved in the farming practices.
 
We need to ensure a rational distribution of resources to everyone involved in agriculture. Be it the farmer, the picker, or the seller, everyone needs an equal share. Suppose the product required is an organic vegetable seed. Each person from the farmer who grows the vegetable to get the seed to the person who delivers the product to your doorstep adds value.

One must always be grateful to the farmer for making it possible for you to have a healthy meal.

The fairness in the distribution of resources should not be restricted to humans. We must also ensure that the animals, plants and other organisms involved in the environment has a better quality of living. Thus organic farming can bring humans closer to nature ensuring harmony.
 
</p>

4.	Care:
</b>
To fulfil these ideologies, we must take special care about every step. We must have a vision of the future, a planet in which the environment is in harmony.
 
We must take the responsibility to care for our land and environment from toxic substances. If not taken care these substances can get accumulated in our bodies and affect us in the long run.
Thus every process involved in agriculture must be in harmony with nature.
Thus if you are planning to start growing organic plants or buy organic products, keep in mind these guiding principles.
